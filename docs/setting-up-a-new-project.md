# Setting up a new project

``` console

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

```

As a general rule, when starting the app normally delete the logo.svg, the App.css file and remove both imports from App.js.

The index.css file can also be edited to add a global font family and any styles that should apply across all components.
